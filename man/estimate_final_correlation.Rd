\usage{
estimate_final_correlation(
  obj,
  n_obs = 1e+05,
  cor_type = "pearson",
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{S3 class object of type \code{simdesign} (or inheriting from it).}

\item{n_obs}{Number of observations to simulate.}

\item{cor_type}{Can be either a character (\code{pearson}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall}) which is
passed to \verb{\link[stats:cor]\{stats::cor\}} or a function, which is directly
used to compute the correlation matrix on the simulated data. Such a
function is expected to take a single input matrix (and possibly other
arguments which can be set via \code{...}) and output a single matrix.}

\item{seed}{Random number seed. NULL does not change the current seed.}

\item{...}{Further arguments are passed to the function that computes the correlation
matrix (either \verb{\link[stats:cor]\{stats::cor\}} or the user provided function).}
}
\description{
Used to obtain an estimate of the correlation matrix after transforming
the initial data.
}
\details{
This function is useful to estimate the final correlation of the data after
transformation of the initial data. To provide a robust estimate it is
advised to use a very large number of observations to compute the correlation
matrix.
